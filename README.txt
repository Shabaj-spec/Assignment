First of all, I reused the code from assignment 2.

To make my website compatible with desktop, mobile, and tablet sizes, I implemented media queries in my stylesheet.css from lines 166 to 174 for mobile devices. For tablet devices lines 176 to 185. For Desktop, lines 187 to 199. I also used flex-wrap on line 156 for the images so that in mobile and tablet sizes the image don't go off-screen. Setting the flex-wrap value to wrap, the image will automatically come down to give a proper view on mobile and tablet devices. For the JS implementation required by the instruction, I implemented all the JS features. Now, I am giving an overview:

1. Notifications: I implemented notifications in my script.js from lines 2 to 10. Whenever the website will be opened, a notification will pop up in the top left corner. You can either block it or allow it.

2. Conditional: I used conditional to validate my form which is situated on lines 54 to 71 in my favoritegame.html. The JS code is implemented in my script.js from lines 20 to 47. If someone does not fill out the form properly, it will give the warning to fill it properly. Otherwise, it won't be submitted.

3. Color changer: First of all I created some buttons on all three web pages. In index.html, it is implemented on lines 25 to 27. In favoritegame.html, it is implemented on lines 12 to 14. In gameplay.html, it is implemented on lines 12 to 14. Now, for the JS part, I implemented the code in my script.js from lines 49 to 51. Whenever the set of buttons will be clicked, the background color of the web pages will be changed.

4. Event handler: To implement the event handler I wrote a function in my gameplay.html from lines 15 to 19. For the JS code, I implemented it in my script.js from lines 53 to 68. The purpose of this code is, whenever someone inputs their age and clicks the check age button, they will receive a message showing whether the website is eligible for them or not. I set the age to 11 to be eligible for the website. So, someone who is not 11 years old will receive a message saying this website is not eligible for you. If someone inputs a negative digit, it will show, "Please enter a valid age!". 

Accessibility: To make my website accessible to every type of person, I always kept in mind all the things. Like, most of my code is keyboard focusable. The font size is perfect. All my images have alt tags. For the videos, I added captions to understand the content easily. I used no flashing context. I also applied all the C.R.A.P rules. I picked the colors that way so that the content is visible even if the person is color-blind. I tried to repeat the same colors throughout my web pages except for the background color. I also set all of the contents with proper space and alignment. No arbitrary contents in the web pages. For, proximity I kept all the images together, all the links together, and also the videos.
