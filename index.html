<p><b>I want to write about video games as it is trendy nowadays.</b></p>
<p><i><u><b>Here we go</u></b></i>:Video gaming is a desired hobby among adults and also teenagers. The amount of time spent on video games is increasing day by day. Playing Video games has some benefits, such as improving focus, multitasking, and working memory, but it may also come with costs when used heavily. When someone spends much time in video games, they may risk their educational and future attainment, problems with friends and family members, and lack the skills to communicate in society. There are different types of video games, such are given below:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Sandbox</li>
    <li>Real-time strategy (RTS)</li>
    <li>Shooters (FPS and TPS)</li>
    <li>Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA)</li>
    <li>Role-playing (RPG, ARPG, and More)</li>
    <li>Simulation and sports</li>
    <li>Puzzlers and party games</li>
    <li>Action-adventure</li>
    <li>Survival and horror</li>
    <li>Platformer</li>
</ol>
<p><b>There are also different types of games within this genre.I am giving the example of Role-playing (RPG, ARPG, and More)</b>:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>RPG:</b> Encompasses various niches and sub-genres, ranging from tabletop gaming with cards and dice (Dungeons & Dragons) to video game RPGs (Fallout).<b>RPG</b> examples:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Skyrim </li>
        <li>The Witcher 3 </li>
        <li>Fallout 4 </li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>ARPG:</b> Action RPGs strongly emphasize combat but include many of the characteristics of a standard RPG, like The Witcher 3. </li>
    <li><b>CRPG:</b> “Computer RPG” is typically used to describe Western-developed RPGs created for PC gamers, like the first two Fallout games. </li>
    <li><b>MMORPG:</b> Combines the massively multiplayer online genre format with RPG gameplay, with notable titles like World of Warcraft, EVE Online, and Elder Scrolls Online. </li>
    <li>T<b>RPG:</b> Short for tactical role-playing games, TRPGs resemble strategy games but place a more profound emphasis on creative thinking and short-term decision-making, like the XCOM series. </li>
    <li><b>Roguelike:</b> Strict definitions feature turn-based gameplay, some form of permadeath, tile graphics, and procedural generation. However, many newer and famous examples, like The Binding of Isaac and Spelunky, focus more on action and platforming. </li>
    <li><b>Roguelite:</b> Does not include one or more critical elements of a typical roguelike. Definitions for this sub-genre will vary, but Rogue Legacy is a widely accepted example.
    </li>
 </ol> 
 <p>Some recognized <b>Action-Adventure</b> games are:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</li>
 <li>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</li>
 <li>Assassin's Creed</li>
 </ul>
